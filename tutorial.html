    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <p>Platformer Jump is a platformer: a game where you jump on platforms to move around.<br>So it is important to know what platforms do what, and how to move. First, the arrow keys move you up, left and right (and the down key does nothing). Most blocks are <b>platforms</b>, which are blocks that you can stand on, jump off of, etc. These are usually the most common blocks in a level.<br>Then come <b>water blocks</b>, which are blocks that you can swim in. They are not solid, but mostly give you a chance to to midair jumps.<br>The deadly blocks are next: <b>Lava blocks</b>. These are just what you would expect: Lethal lava that kills you on contact. Avoid these at all cost! <br>And you can win in two ways: By touching <b>green blocks</b> or by touching the very top of the level. You can also (in addition to by lava) be killed by dropping to the bottom of the screen.<br>And the wonkiest of all blocks, the <b>trampoline</b>, makes you jump when you walk upon it, and is a lot of fun to use. <br>Finally, there must be <i>some</i> kind of way to make the hardest levels a bit easier, right? That is where <b>checkpoints</b> come in. Their job is to respawn you on top of them whenever you die (of course, once you touch them). These are very convenient and easy to use.</p>
    <p>So you must be ready for any level, right? Give it a shot! You can try a <a href="/random">random level</a> that challenges you to get to the top. Good luck!</p>

      <h2>Playing others' levels</h2>
      <p>We hope that you had fun with the random level, but that can only be fun for so long. You might find yourself wanting to move on to something else--something specially made to be tricky or fun.<br>There is a solution: user-made levels. People can make their own custom levels, name them, and share them for the world.<br>You can find these levels at <a href="/levels">the levels page</a>. Each level has a URL that is as such: platformer--426729.repl.co/levels/insert level name here. For example: platformer--426729.repl.co/levels/easy.<br>Have fun playing people's levels, and a warning: Not all are possible!</p>

      <h2>Making a level</h2>
      <p>Now, by the time you read this, you probably have already played a few user-created levels. But what's more fun than playing levels? Making levels! You can use the <a href="/editor">level editor</a> to make and share your own levels! We will start with customization and laying out a level.<br>You can place platforms/blocks/lava, etc. by clicking a block in the level editor. If you want to place different blocks, you can select a certain color on the palette above the grid. There are seven colors to choose from (see the blocks in the first section) and one bar that shows what selection you have. So you can use these different blocks to build great levels that start at gray and end at green!<br>But there's one more thing. What if you want the player not to jump high, or to move slow like a slug? Well, you can change the customization options to do that. You can either specify a color (for example, yellow) to paint your platforms (or you can let the game randomize the color every round), you can set jump height and even movement speed. You can do this by using the parameters above the grid. Good luck!</p>

      <h2>Sharing your levels</h2>
      <p>Now that you have a level in the level editor, it is time to release it to the world! You can do this by first giving your level a name (it must be unique) and specifying an editing password. An editing password is a special password that you use to edit your level (more on that later). Then, once you put in a password, press the 'Post level' button to share your level with the world! A new tab will open and you will be able to play your wonderful level. It will also be shared to the levels page. Congratulations! Now, if you want to edit your level, the password makes it so that you can come back to change your level by loading up the level with the 'Edit level with Level Name' button, making the changes and putting in the editing password. If you do this and you enter the right editing password, your level will be updated. Yay!</p>
